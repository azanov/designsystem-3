The hallmark of these reports is that the data is then analyzed to produce a number of recommendations which show the customer how to save more money, save time, or use their meter more effectively. These reports are distributed through MyAccount, and customers will get an email each quarter with a reminder to log in and check their reports. Through these we hope to establish a digital relationship with our clients. Methods: Clustering, Regression",
