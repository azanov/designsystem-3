      <p>Today, users expect to see graceful movement in product UIs when moving from one state to another, loading tables and charts, and displaying alerts and other forms of user feedback. Such visual effects should be subtle — never intrusive — so as to support our users’ experience, aid in their comprehension and provide them with moments of delight.</p>

      <p>
        When using these effects we follow some basic guiding principles. Good motion and animation, when applied, aims to:
      </p>

      <h5>
        Keeps the User Oriented and In Control
      </h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Is meaningful and doesn’t get in the user’s way</li>
        <li>Is timed just right — neither too fast nor too slow</li>
        <li>Provides information and feedback in a delightful, unexpected manner</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>
        Maintains a Responsive and Intuitive UI
      </h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Demystifies and clarifies the product and experience</li>
        <li>Responds to users’ actions and system events</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>
        Reinforces Our Brand and Its Elements
      </h5>

      <ul>
        <li>Supports our core attributes: smart, approachable, ambitious, energizing</li>
        <li>Incorporates and extends our signature brand elements, such as colors, iconography, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>
        Applies Classic, Natural Animation Behaviors
      </h5>

      <p>
        From early Disney pictures, to Pixar’s modern classics, to the animations you see on smartphones every day — the proper use of motion and animation can make the difference between a pedestrian user experience and an exciting, engaging one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are some considerations to keep in mind when designing animations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>UI elements and patterns should feel natural.</li>
        <li>Objects’ movement should reflect the laws of gravity, mass and inertia.</li>
        <li>Animation choices should create anticipation in the user.</li>
        <li>Movement should indicate needed user action or highlight information that merits attention.</li>
        <li>An animation sequence should cover an entire user action from start to finish.</li>
        <li>Motion should emphasize what’s most important to the user at a given moment in time.</li>
      </ul>
