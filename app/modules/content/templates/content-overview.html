      <p class="doc-lede">Content is a critical part of the user experience. Even the best-designed product won’t be usable to customers if its on-screen copy or supporting materials are is confusing, inaccurate or inconsistent. So treat your product’s writing and other communication assets as seriously as you would any other aspect of its development.</p>

      <h3>Writing Domains</h3>
      <p>Three writing domains inform all Pitney Bowes communications and determine how well our writing supports our brand at the product level:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tone of voice: copywriting that aligns with our brand’s personality attributes</li>
        <li>Editorial style: grammar, capitalization, usage, and point of view</li>
        <li>Terminology: words and phrases used to express concepts, features and functions in a consistent way</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Core Content for Products</h3>
      <p>This guidance deals with how to apply the overall Pitney Bowes brand voice to your products. In most cases this applies to the copy the user sees on the screen while using your responsive web or mobile apps — items like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Errors, <a href="" ui-sref="elements.popovers({'#':'modals'})">modals</a> and other <a href="" ui-sref="feedback.page">user feedback</a> copy</li>
        <li>Textual headers, menus, buttons, inputs and other <a href="" ui-sref="elements.uicontrols({'#':'writing'})">UI elements</a></li>
        <li><a href="" ui-sref="patterns.gettingstarted">Getting started</a>, <a href="" ui-sref="patterns.signinup">sign in and sign up</a>, and account-related screens</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>Supporting Content for Products</h3>
      <p>Other user-facing materials are created by various different teams at Pitney Bowes in areas like marketing, documentation and support. These materials include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Welcome” and other customer emails</li>
        <li>Equipment manuals, Send Kits and other printed materials</li>
        <li>Help systems, FAQs and other online product support content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s a good idea to coordinate with your colleagues in other departments when launching a product to ensure that its content is consistent across the entire communications spectrum and lifecycle.</p>
